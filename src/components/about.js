      <p>
        I was born in 1988 and I live in Helsinki. I'm Master of Arts from
        University of Helsinki, where I majored in musicology and minored in
        aesthetics and art history. I have some work experience from fields of
        culture and arts and am now working as a software engineer at Eficode.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found my passion for programming in 2017 and have since been on this
        never-ending self-learning path. After learning the basics, I've been
        focusing on modern web technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides programming, I enjoy making music, playing casual blitz chess
        and doing various physical activities like bodyweight training, cycling,
        running and hiking.
