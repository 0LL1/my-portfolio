      <p>
        I was born in 1988 and I live in Helsinki. I'm Master of Arts from
        University of Helsinki, where I majored in musicology and minored in
        aesthetics and art history. I have work experience from fields of
        culture and arts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I found my passion for programming in 2017 and have since been on this
        never-ending self-learning path. After learning the basics, I've been
        focusing on modern front-end technologies. I'm comfortable with
        JavaScript related stuff like ES6+, React (including the new Hooks API),
        Gatsby and create-react-app. CSS-wise I can do responsive and adaptive
        design, layouts using grid and flexbox, CSS-in-JS and other essential
        things.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now I'm most interested in learning tech like GraphQL, TypeScript,
        Apollo, Next and automated testing â€“ and obviously mastering JS and CSS.
        All in all, I like to keep myself up to date with current best
        practices, whatever they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides programming, I enjoy making music, playing casual blitz chess
        and doing various physical activities like bodyweight training, running,
        cycling, hiking and swimming.

        Most importantly: I'm looking for a full-time position in the industry,
